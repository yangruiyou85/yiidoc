Yii Documentation Project
=========================

This project aims to translate Yii core messages, system views
and various documentation into different languages.

The directory structure is shown at the end of this file, where
<lang> stands for the language code for a particular language
(e.g. 'de' for German, 'zh_cn' for simplified Chinese).

File is the basic unit of translations. For each file to be
translated, you should create a new file with the same name and
save it under an appropriate directory. For example, in order to
translate the "database.ar.txt" file of the definitive guide into
German, you should save the translated file as "guide/de/database.ar.txt".

**************************************************************
MARE SURE YOU USE UTF-8 ENCODING WHEN SAVING YOUR TRANSLATION.
**************************************************************

Check in frequently instead of waiting till you finish all
translations. As there may be several people translating in
the same language, checking in frequently may help reduce
duplicated work. It also gives other people chance to review
your translation ealier.

If you participated in translating the Guide, you may leave your
name in the "index.txt" page, saying "translated by Your Name".

We will include the latest translations into every release of Yii,
and also display them online.

Thank you for your support and contribution to Yii!


How to Synchronize Messages
---------------------------

We have a tool to help synchronize changes made to Yii core messages
and requirement checker messages. Check out an SVN copy of Yii
framework. On command line under the "build" directory, run
the following command:

build message ../framework/messages/config.php

This will extract original messages from Yii framework and merge
them with the translations under the "messages" directory. You can
now check the merged file to see if there is any change since you
translate the messages last time. Similar procedure applies to
the requirement checker messages, which can be synchronized using
the following command:

build message ../requirements/messages/config.php
